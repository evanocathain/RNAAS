<b> UTMOST Injection Research Note</b>

Research note written just after https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02293
version 1 was uploaded to astro-ph. Only possible due to data sharing
and helpful conversations with said paper's authors. Long story short
the injection recovery (and lack there of) all makes sense and the
picture is not as bad as one might assume from reading version 1. So,
good news. Phew! After discussions with the authors we decided
together that this was better as just a note for them, to help them in
their preparations for version 2 of their paper (as version 1 was only
submitted to MNRAS, and hadn't yet been refereed) rather than to
submit as a RNAAS.

In the end, unfortunately, no edits were made to their revised paper
to MNRAS and it went through accepted with the issues addressed here
in the final version. After this, and so that there would be a record
of this analysis 'out there' I actually submitted this note of mine to
MNRAS; it was MNRAS as it was too long for a RNAAS as it happened.
This was after getting the acquiescence of the authors of the original
motivating paper. However they later changed their mind, after I'd
submitted it to MNRAS, so I decided to just leave it as an
astro-ph-only paper and pursue it no further. 

Bit of a saga. But the upshot is actually that their injection tests
work considerably better than they claim.
