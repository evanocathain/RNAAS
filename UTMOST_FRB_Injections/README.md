<b> UTMOST Injection Research Note</b>

Research note written just after https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02293
version 1 was uploaded to astro-ph. Only possible due to data sharing
and helpful conversations with said paper's authors. Long story short
the injection recovery (and lack there of) all makes sense and the
picture is not as bad as one might assume from reading version 1. So,
good news. Phew! After discussions with the authors decided this was
better as just a note for them, to help them in their preparations for
version 2 (as version 1 was only submitted to MNRAS, and hadn't yet
been refereed) rather than to submit as a RNAAS.
